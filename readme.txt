Synopsis:
=========
This archive contains the implementation of Newton interpolating polynomial for
estimates of free energy differences using thermodynamic integration. It also
contains an example data file to jumpstart the use of software. The
implementation makes heavy use of STL (standard template library) which
requires a C++ compiler. This program is self-contained and should not require
any additional libraries.

To compile the program, simply type:

make

The make program will invoke the Makefile and compiles the source code.
Alternatively, to compile the files manually, issue the command:

g++ -I. driver.cpp newton.cpp -o newton -lm

The archive lists three implementation files and an example file.

Filename        Descriptions
------------    -----------------------------
driver.cpp      the user interface program
newton.cpp      the main implementation of Newton interpolation polynomial
newton.h        the header file for Lagrange interpolation polynomial
example.csv     example file of simulations data from thermodynamic integration
Makefile        the makefile to compile the source code
readme.txt      this file

The purpose of this program is to construct a Newton interpolating polynomial
that fits the thermodynamic integration data. The implementation also contains
an estimate function that allows the interpolating polynomial be used to
extrapolate points. This feature may be useful to determine the accuracy of the
interpolating polynomial.

The Newton interpolation program takes three command-line parameters:
input_file, plot_file [optional], and data_points [optional]. The followings
detail the format and meaning of each command-line parameter.

input_file
----------
The input file must be saved in the plain text format. The first column contains
the lambda values and second the ensemble averages from the simulations. Each
column of data must be separated by either a comma or a white space. For example,
the followings list the contents of the example input file:

0.0,  51.49866347
0.1,  23.92508775
0.2,  10.35390700
0.3,   2.58426990
0.4,  -2.18351656
0.5,  -5.41745387
0.6,  -7.62452181
0.7,  -9.25455804
0.8, -10.45592989
0.9, -11.39244138
1.0, -12.12433704

To run the analysis program with only the required parameter, type:

newton example.csv

The program will output the interpolating polynomial and the estimates of free
energy using the Newton interpolating polynomial and trapezoidal rule. For
example, the example file should generate the following output:

Degree, Coefficients
     0,      51.49866347
     1,    -440.06771988
     2,    2724.49944200
     3,  -16355.52325204
     4,   74074.45611540
     5, -226406.51705359
     6,  454849.19406749
     7, -590543.95494381
     8,  476225.01322752
     9, -216633.75369268
    10,   42443.03080908

Free energy difference
 Lagrange: 0.65644834
Trapezoid: 1.02220063

plot_file
---------
This parameter specifies the name of the file that contains the estimates
obtained from the interpolating polynomial. This parameter is optional. If this
parameter is not given, no plot data will be generated by the program. For
example, to generate a file of plot data with the default number of data points
extrapolated from the interpolating polynomial, issue the command:

newton example.csv plot.csv

The file, example.csv, is the input file that contains the thermodynamic
integration data. The file, plot.csv, is the output file that contains the
estimates from the interpolating polynomial.

data_points
-----------
This parameter specifies the number of data points extrapolated from the
interpolating polynomial. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not
given, the number of data points will be the same as the input file. For
example, to generate a file of plot data with 100 data points extrapolated from
the interpolating polynomial, issue the command:

newton example.csv plot.csv 100


Author's Comments:
==================
It is strongly recommended to limit the number of lambda values to less than a
dozen. High degree of Newton polynomials suffers greatly from numerical
instability. The analysis from the program can fluctuate widely and becomes
completely unreliable (see the reference for more information).

Please report any problems or send comments to me at conradshyu at hotmail.com.

Note: Lagrange and Newton polynomials are mathematically equivalent. The
numerical differences are only notable after the eight digit. The Newton
polynomial is generally considered more computationally efficient than
Lagrange.
